# IST Rendered Point Cloud Dataset
<p>
Six different voxelized PCs from MPEG repository are compressed with three different codecs in three different rates representing low, medium and high quality. Octree-based compresseion scheme in PCL, MPEG G-PCC and MPEG V-PCC point cloud codecs have been used. Rates are selected based on the coding parameters suggested in MPEG Common Test Conditions(CTC). More details can be found in the article (will be updated soon)</br>
</p>
<p>
Three different rendering solutions are used to render the decoded PCs: </br>
•	<b>RPoint session:</b> The decoded PCs have uniform color and shading with a point-based representation.</br>
•	<b>RMesh session:</b> The decoded PCs have uniform color, surface shading and a mesh-based representation.</br>
•	<b>RColor session:</b> The decoded PCs have original texture, no shading and a point-based representation.</br>
</p>
<p>
Decoded PCs were evaluated by people through a subjective test in three different sessions for each rendering methods. Table of MOS scores for each test session is also provided.
